## CSRF

forcing a user to execute unwanted actions on a web application usually where they are already authenticated. Helped by social engineering with use of autosubmitting webpages.

I have some examples of html pages in the script folder of CSRF attacks.

## SQLi

code injection technique to attack data driven applications by inserting malicous sql statements into an unprotected entry field to be executed on the victims database.

1=1 attacks are very common but union attacks are too, see information schema to help with sql injection attacks

sqlmap is your friends, I also have a time based attack int he scripts folder

# Directory traversal

method of accessing files thought to not be in the scope of the user. most common technique of finding so is to use  ../../../../../......./etc/passwd essentaiily meaning if you add loads of ../ before etc/passwd then u should get there because the backend willonly parse up to the root directory which is the hiughest it can go.

sometimes adding a ./././ can also help as some applications look for ../../../../ when trying to get rid of it and adding some ./././ can mitigate against getting caught in filters.
